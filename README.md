GCP related stuff for DxPointz

# Setup

## Prerequisites

### Serverless Framework

Install serverless framework globally: `npm i -g serverless`

#### GCP Credentials

The GCF credentials can be a little tricky to set up. Luckily we've documented this for you here:
https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/google/guide/credentials/
the path to the credentials file needs to be absolute

> the considered path to your credentials is: ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json

## Install

Run `npm i`
